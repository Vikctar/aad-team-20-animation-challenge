## Fetching data
**Retrofit2** library is used.
Retrofit is a REST Client for Java Android. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data)
via a REST based webservice, IMDB API for this case.

Retrofit2 by default leverages OkHttp as the networking layer and is built on top of it.
Retrofit automatically serialises the JSON response using a POJO(Plain Old Java Object) which must be defined in advanced for the JSON Structure.
